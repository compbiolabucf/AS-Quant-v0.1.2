AS-Quant generates the expression level of alternative splicing among two different biological conditions.

# Installation
AS-Quant tool can be downloaded/cloned directly from github. Users need to have python3 installed on their machine. It can work both on Windows and Linux platforms.

Users will need to run the as-quant.py file in order to demonstrate the Alternative Splicing events.
$python3 as_quant.py

To generate plots for specific exon, user need to run makePlots.py and provide input in a specific pattern: chromName:geneName:start-end
$python3 make_plots.py

# User manual
User manual for AS-Quant is available on github https://github.com/compbiolabucf/AS-Quant-v0.1.2/blob/main/AS-Quant_User_Manual.pdf

# Sample data
AS-Quant example data for mouse(mouse mm10) is included in the folder https://github.com/compbiolabucf/AS-Quant/tree/master/Sample_input_mouse. To run from scratch, user can use the sample data for quantization of AS events.
